    "content11": "React is an open-source, front end, JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.",
    "title2": "What is react-i18next?",
    "content21": "react-i18next is a powerful internationalization framework for React / React Native which is based on i18next. The module provides multiple components eg. to assert that needed translations get loaded or that your content gets rendered when the language changes.",
    "content22": "react-i18next is optimally suited for server-side rendering. It provides extra extension point to work with next.js. As react-i18next depends on i18next you can use it in any other UI framework and on the server-side (node.js, .net, ...) too."
